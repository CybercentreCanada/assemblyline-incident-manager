# General Description
This repository contains two Python scripts used for triaging compromised systems with Assemblyline.
1. The "Pusher" (`al-incident-submitter`): pushes files from the compromised system to an Assemblyline
instance for analysis.
2. The "Puller" (`al-incident-analyzer`): pulls the submissions from the
Assemblyline instance and reports on if the submissions are safe/unsafe.
3. The "Downloader" (`al-incident-downloader`): downloads files submitted to Assemblyline that are under a certain 
score threshold, matching the folder structure of the files as they were submitted.
   

# How do I use this thing?
## General Process
The "Pusher" needs to run from the compromised machine, which needs network access to the Assemblyline instance
which it will be sending files to.

The "Puller" needs to run from a machine that has network access to the Assemblyline instance
which you sent files to via the "Pusher". It is considered good practice to run the "Puller" from a machine that 
isn't compromised.

The "Downloader" needs to run on a machine where you want all clean files downloaded to. This machine needs network 
access to the Assemblyline instance that you sent files to via the "Pusher".

## Prequisites
For the machine(s) running the "Pusher", the "Puller", and the "Downloader":
- You will need at least Python 3
  - Download here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- If on Linux, you will need to install the following packages via APT/YUM: `libffi-dev`, `libssl-dev`
  - By command line: 
    - (APT) `sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev`
    - (YUM) `sudo yum install libffi-dev libssl-dev`
  - By browser, download .deb files here: https://packages.debian.org/jessie/libffi-dev, https://packages.debian.org/jessie/libssl-dev
- You will need the `assemblyline-incident-manager` PIP module and its dependencies installed
  - `pip install assemblyline-incident-manager`
- For the offline installation of these packages and libraries, see the Offline Installation section

In general:
- You will need the URL of an Assemblyline instance that you have an account on. 
  - Want to create your own Assemblyline instance? [HOW-TO](https://cybercentrecanada.github.io/assemblyline4_docs/docs/installation.html)
- You will need two API keys generated by Assemblyline, ideally one with read access and another with write access. 
The Write-only key will be used for the "Pusher", and the Read-only key will be used for the "Puller" and the "Downloader".
  - It is considered best practice to not use an API key that has both Read-Write access, so 
  we *highly* recommend using two keys.
    
### Offline Installation
You will need to run the following code from a machine that has Internet access and then transfer it to the machine
that does not have Internet access.
#### Linux:
```
mkdir offline_packages
sudo su
apt-get install --download-only python3 python3-pip libffi-dev libssl-dev --reinstall -y
mv /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb ~/offline_packages
python3 -m pip download pip assemblyline-incident-manager -d ~/offline_packages
exit
tar -czvf offline_packages.tar.gz ~/offline_packages/
Copy this file over using SCP, FTP or some other method
```

On the machine that is offline, do the following:
```
tar -xzvf offline_packages.tar.gz
cd offline_packages
sudo apt-get install ./*.deb -y
for x in `ls *.whl`;  do python3 -m pip install $x; done
```

#### Windows
- Download and install the most recent Python .msi installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/release. 
- Upgrade PIP: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- Install the required PIP packages: `python3 -m pip download assemblyline-incident-manager`
