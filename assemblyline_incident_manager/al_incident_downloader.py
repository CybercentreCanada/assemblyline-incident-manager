"""
This file contains the code that does the "pulling". It requests all of the files that the user
has submitted to Assemblyline for analysis via the "pusher".

The difference between this file and the results_analyzer.py is that this file is mainly about retrieving
files that are under a certain score threshold according to Assemblyline, and building a directory containing
these files.

There are 4 phases in the script, each documented accordingly.
